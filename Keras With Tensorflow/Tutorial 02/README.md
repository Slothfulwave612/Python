## Directory Tree

```

## Overview

* Here in this tutorial we will take a look on how to build a CNN using Keras integrated with TensorFlow.

* We will be using a data set from the [Kaggle Dogs Versus Cats competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data). 

* Prerequisite: Understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Organize The Data

* We now need to organize the directory structure on disk to hold the data set. 

* We'll manually do some parts of the organization, and programmatically do the rest.
